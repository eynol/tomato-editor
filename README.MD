# Tomato editor
----
I have a chromebook(armv7), it sucked when I got disconnected with Internet.
So I want to make it work fine when I was offline, only to make it a progressive web app.


## Broswer support
**NOTICE**: I can only make sure tomato editor can work fine on the latest Chrome browser.

## Licence 
yet not decided.
